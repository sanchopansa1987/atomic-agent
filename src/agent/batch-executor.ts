 * used to run a bare `python3` — exit 0, nothing done — with the script
 * silently dropped, and the worker reported the work as done; a tool
 * with no schema is exempt, and F33's key normalisation runs first so a
 * quoted or fused key that means a schema key is not refused.
 *
 * Either refusal is an ordinary error result — recorded in the loop
 * tracker like any other, on the trace row via `details.corrupted` /
 * `details.unknownKeys` — that the model reads on its next step; no
