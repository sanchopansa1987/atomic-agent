 * Append-only trace event emitted by the runtime for postmortem analysis
 * and prompt replay. Every event carries a monotonic `seq` within a
 * session, a wall-clock `ts`, and — when applicable — the `turnIndex` /
 * `stepIndex` context.
 *
 * Design notes:
 * - The union is `type`-discriminated so NDJSON consumers can branch on a
 *   single field.
 * - `session_started` / `trace_truncated` are the only events without a
 *   turn context; everything else carries `turnIndex`.
 * - Secret redaction is NOT applied here (NON-goal for this milestone).
 *   The sink writes payloads verbatim; consumers must treat traces as
