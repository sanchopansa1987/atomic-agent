 * Memoised token cost of a single rendered turn.

 * step, so O(N^2) transient allocation across a long turn. Issue #121
 * reported ~10MB of churn for a 25-step turn.
 *
 * Turns are immutable once appended, so the cost is keyed on the turn
 * object itself. `inCurrentMacroTurn` changes what the renderer emits for
 * fresh-bypass tools (`os.http.request`, fresh `gog` shell), so it is part
 * of the key rather than folded away. The `WeakMap` lets dropped turns be
